# Track Leaks

## Description
Track Leaks is a C project that provides a mechanism to track memory allocations and deallocations using custom wrappers for `malloc` and `free` functions. It includes a header file `track_leaks.h` with logging functionality to record allocation and deallocation events.

## Features
- Custom `malloc` and `free` wrappers with logging capabilities.
- Logs memory allocation and deallocation events with address, source file, and line number information.
- Helps in detecting memory leaks and tracking memory usage in C programs.

## Usage
To use Track Leaks in your C program:
1. Include the `track_leaks.h` header file in your source code.
2. Compile your program with the `track_leaks.h` header file included.
3. Run your program to generate logs in the file `adrress_logs.py` with memory allocation and deallocation information.

## Installation
Simply include the `track_leaks.h` header file in your project and compile it along with your source code.

## Example
```c
#include "track_leaks.h"
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int *ptr = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int));
    *ptr = 10;
    printf("Value: %d\n", *ptr);
    free(ptr);
    return 0;
}
```

## Memory Leak Detection Helper Script
You can use the provided helper script `get_leak_address.sh` to detect memory leaks after running your program. Follow these steps:
1. Place the `get_leak_address.sh` script in the same directory as your executable.
2. Compile and run your program.
3. Execute the `get_leak_address.sh` script with your executable name as an argument to check for memory leaks.

```bash
./get_leak_address.sh your_executable_name
```

The script will analyze the logs generated by your program and report any memory leaks found along with their locations.

This README now includes instructions for using the helper script to detect memory leaks in your Track Leaks project.
